## Recommendations

Based on the business problem and the findings, I recommend that:

1.Microsoftstudios can choose to produce either Drama or Action,Adventure,Sci-Fi.

Microsoft studios can start by producing drama movies and variation like damma, comedy, animation since they are cheap to produce and relatively profitable compared to other genres and they have good ratings.

After increasing viewership of their movies, Microsoft studios can proceed to produce Action,Adventure,Sci-Fi which is the most profitable but expensive to produce. Microsoft owns popular video game franchises (Halo, Gears of War) with established storylines and fan bases. Adapting these to movies or TV shows could be a strategic entry point, leveraging existing intellectual property (IP).

2.Microsoft should commission other studios to recommend the best distribution channel for its movies. We could not do this since the data was not available.

3.Microsoft should leverage on its already existing presence and budget to procure good show writers. A well-written script with strong execution can lead to success even with a lower budget. Invest in script development and focus on high-concept stories with broad appeal.

4.Later on Microsoft studios should consider a study on the market share and how acquiring smaller independent studios would help them grow their market share and viewership.
